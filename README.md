# Zombies
 
A game designing project where I try to recreate the game Call of Duty Zombies, with some adjustments and ideas of my own. It is a work in progress and updates are being added as fast as I can get to it. This is more of a showcase of how I am working and my methods. Everything in the game is done by me and either created by me or taken using free assets. I intend to make my assests in the long run. I am also learning things alsong the way an that is why this has taken the time it has. Thanks for looking through this. I also appreciate feedbacks if you would like to leave some.
